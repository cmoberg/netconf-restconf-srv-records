      <t>
        NETCONF and RESTCONF are network management protocols that allow
        for programmatic approaches to network device manageability. Both
        protocols use a remote procedure call (RPC) paradigm where clients
        connect to servers to execute protocol operations, and servers
        respond to the operations or sends notifications to the client.
        The purpose of this document is to provide DNS SRV RRs such that:</t>

        IANA maintains a registry of service names and port numbers

        names maintained in the registry can be used with DNS SRV records to
        allow clients to ask for specific services for a specific domain
        as described in <xref target="RFC2782"/>. In addition, these service
        names can be used for dynamic service discovery as defined in

        The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and
        delete the configuration of network devices. This document defines
        SRV service labels for NETCONF over SSH <xref target="RFC6242"/>,
        and NETCONF over TLS <xref target="RFC7589"/>. NETCONF protocol sessions
        can be initiated by the client or by server in the call home.

      <t>
      RESTCONF is an HTTP-based protocol that provides a programmatic interface
      for accessing data defined in YANG, using the datastores defined in NETCONF.
    </t>
      <t>
      RESTCONF is defined on top of HTTP, but due to the sensitive nature
      of the information conveyed, RESTCONF requires that the transport-layer
      protocol provides both data integrity and confidentiality, such as are
      provided by the TLS protocol <xref target="RFC5246"/>. HTTP sessions
      can be initiated by the RESTCONF client or by the RESTCONF server in the
      case of RESTCONF call home. This specification adds two new SRV
      service labels for RESTCONF:

    <section anchor="sec" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        The security considerations spelled out in the DNS SRV
        specification <xref target="RFC2782"/> apply. In general, the
        usage of DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/> is recommended in
        environments where DNS cannot be trusted.
      </t>
      <t>
        The usage of multicast DNS protocols to discover network
        management services potentially introduces new security risks
        since such protocols usually assume cooperating
        participants. In an environment where antagonistic
        participants exists, it is necessary to deploy additional
        security mechanism such as DNSSEC to securely discover network
        management services.
