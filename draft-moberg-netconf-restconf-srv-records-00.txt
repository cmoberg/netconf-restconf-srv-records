1.  Introduction

   This document specifies Domain Name Service (DNS) SRV Resource
   Records (RRs) [RFC2782] to locate NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF
   [RFC8040] servers and clients.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Background

   NETCONF and RESTCONF are network management protocols that allow for
   programmatic approaches to network device manageability.  Both
   protocols use a remote procedure call (RPC) paradigm where clients
   connect to servers to execute protocol operations, and servers
   respond to the operations or sends notifications to the client.  The
   purpose of this document is to provide DNS SRV RRs such that:

      Clients can discover servers for the purpose of direct management

      Servers can discover the clients for the purpose of device call
      home as defined in [RFC8071]

3.  Service Names

   IANA maintains a registry of service names and port numbers per the
   procedures described in [RFC6335].  The service names maintained in
   the registry can be used with DNS SRV records to allow clients to ask
   for specific services for a specific domain as described in
   [RFC2782].  In addition, these service names can be used for dynamic
   service discovery as defined in [RFC6763].  The following service
   name and port numbers from the registry apply to this document.

4.  NETCONF over SSH and TLS Server and Client

   The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and
   delete the configuration of network devices.  This document defines
   SRV service labels for NETCONF over SSH [RFC6242], and NETCONF over
   TLS [RFC7589].  NETCONF protocol sessions can be initiated by the
   client or by server in the call home.

   _netconf-ssh
           Identifies a NETCONF-over-SSH server

   _netconf-ch-ssh
           Identifies a NETCONF-over-SSH client for call-home

   _netconf-ssh
           Identifies a NETCONF-over-TLS server

   _netconf-ch-ssh
           Identifies a NETCONF-over-TLS client for call-home

   Examples: NETCONF Service Records

     _netconf-ssh._tcp     SRV 0 1 830  netconf-server.example.com.
     _netconf-ch-ssh._tcp  SRV 0 1 4334 netconf-client.example.com.
     _netconf-tls._tcp     SRV 0 1 6513 netconf-server.example.com.
     _netconf-ch-tls._tcp  SRV 0 1 4335 netconf-client.example.com.

   NETCONF clients and servers needs additional information in order to
   establish sessions.  How this information is derived is not specified
   in this document, but described in [RFC8071].

5.  RESTCONF

   RESTCONF is an HTTP-based protocol that provides a programmatic
   interface for accessing data defined in YANG, using the datastores
   defined in NETCONF.  Due to the sensitive nature of the information
   conveyed, RESTCONF requires that the transport-layer protocol
   provides both data integrity and confidentiality, such as are
   provided by the TLS protocol [RFC5246].  HTTP sessions can be
   initiated by the RESTCONF client or by the RESTCONF server in the
   case of RESTCONF call home.  This specification adds two new SRV
   service labels for RESTCONF:

   _restconf-tls
           Identifies a RESTCONF server

   _restconf-ch-tls
           Identifies a RESTCONF client for call-home

   Examples: RESTCONF Service Records

    _restconf-tls._tcp     SRV 0 1 443  restconf-server.example.com.
    _restconf-ch-tls._tcp  SRV 0 1 4336 restconf-client.example.com.

   RESTCONF clients and servers needs additional information in order to
   establish sessions.  How this information is derived is not specified
   in this document, but described in [RFC8071].

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations spelled out in the DNS SRV specification
   [RFC2782] apply.  In general, the usage of DNSSEC [RFC4033] is
   recommended in environments where DNS cannot be trusted.

   The usage of multicast DNS protocols to discover network management
   services potentially introduces new security risks since such
   protocols usually assume cooperating participants.  In an environment
   where antagonistic participants exists, it is necessary to deploy
   additional security mechanism such as DNSSEC to securely discover
   network management services.

7.  Acknowledgements

   The original idea to, and intial content of this draft was written by
   Juergen Schoenwaelder, but any issues or shortcomings of the current
   version is with the current author.
